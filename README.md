# Multimodal AI Agent - News Summarization & Sentiment Analysis

## Abstract

Multi-modal AI agents have become a significant area of interest due to their ability to process and integrate information from multiple data sources. This paper presents the design and implementation of a personalized news aggregator built using multi-modal AI techniques. The system collects news articles, generates summaries using language models, and performs sentiment analysis to deliver relevant and customized content to users. The agent leverages state-of-the-art AI models and frameworks, demonstrating how intelligent automation can be applied to enhance user experiences.

## 1. Introduction

With the exponential growth of online information, users are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of content available. Multi-modal AI agents, which can process text, images, audio, and other data types, offer a promising solution by intelligently filtering and summarizing information. This project focuses on building a multi-modal AI agent designed to aggregate news, summarize articles, and analyze sentiments, making it easier for users to consume personalized content.

The agent combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, sentiment analysis, and summarization models. By leveraging APIs and pre-trained models, the agent automates the process of fetching news articles and presenting concise, sentiment-driven summaries to users.
